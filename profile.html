                Hi, my name is Daan Ketelaars Coreen, a 22 yo digital designer & front-end developer. At the moment I am
                in my
                2nd year of Communication & Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
                I've also done a 4 year MBO education as interactive designer at Mediacollege Amsterdam.
                I wasn't done with learning (I never will haha) and studying, so I went on to my bachelor degree and
                might even go on to get my masters as well, while I'm at it.
            </p>

            <h3>What drives and interests me?</h3>
            <p>
                Well, when starting a new project or working on a project, focusing on the attention to detail and
                making sure
                everything is worked out to perfection. In addition, the
                fact that I can really bring ideas to life,
                pixel by pixel is something that motivates
                me and keeps me striving for more.
            </p>
            <p>I really developed a huge interest for graphic design, art direction, typography, colours, copy and
                composition/layout. When you have a good and clear understanding of these skills you can come a
                long way in building great digital/ non digital products. I would love
                to learn more about these skills and try to master them.
            </p>

            <h3>More about me</h3>

            <p>Besides all of this I do have some other interests and things I do. I've been playing field hockey
                for 16+ years,
                have a great passion for sport and slowly developed more love for art
                and going to a nice museum. Same
                goes for reading books. I enjoy good food, travelling and exploring new spots,
                hanging out with family/friends, watching
                films/series, gaming, photography, music and enjoying a cold one üç∫ (a nice wine will do as well üç∑).
